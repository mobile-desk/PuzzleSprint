Problem:Given an array of integers, return indices i and j (where i â‰  j) such that the sum of the two numbers at those indices equals a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9 Output: [0, 1] (since nums[0] + nums[1] equals the target value 9)
