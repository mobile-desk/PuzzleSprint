Problem:Given a string, determine if it's a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Example:Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama" Output: True (ignoring spaces and punctuation, the string reads the same backward and forward)
