Problem:

Given an array of integers, return indices i and j (where i != j) such that the absolute 
difference between the two indices is at most k, and the absolute difference between the two values 
at indices i and j is at most t.

Example:

Input: nums = [1, 5, 9, 15, 20], k = 3, t = 3
Output: True (there exists indices i = 0 and j = 1 such that the absolute difference between them is 
at most k = 3 and the absolute difference between the values nums[i] = 1 and nums[j] = 5 is at most 
t = 3)
