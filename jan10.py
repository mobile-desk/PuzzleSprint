Problem:Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

Example:Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 5 Output: 2 (since the target 5 is found at index 2)
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 2 Output: 1 (since the target 2 should be inserted at index 1 to maintain sorting order)
